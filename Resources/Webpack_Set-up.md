#Decide on an 'entry' file and an 'output' file for your webpack pipeline.

##Your entry file might be something simple like an index.js, app/main.js, client/app.js or browser/index.js.
Your output file will be created by webpack. You don't need to actually create it yet - just decide where you want it to live. This could be in the root of your app, or a public folder - it's up to you.
