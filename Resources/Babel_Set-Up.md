#Babel-Loader in Webpack
By setting babel-loader in your webpack config, you're teaching webpack to use babel. However, we also need to tell babel how to parse our code. We do this with another dot-file called .babelrc! The .babelrc file in the root directory is used to configure it with the babel-presets you installed.
